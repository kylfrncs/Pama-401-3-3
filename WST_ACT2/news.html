                            peaceful life in the snowy mountains, providing 
                            for them by selling charcoal at the nearby town.

                            family slaughtered in a demon attack, with the
                            exception of his younger sister, Nezuko Kamado,
                            who has begun to transform into a demon herself.
                            A Demon Slayer, Giyu Tomioka, appears to kill
                            Nezuko, but Tanjiro does his best to try and
                            defend her.</p>
